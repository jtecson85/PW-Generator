# PW-Generator

## Purpose
The PW-Generator is like having your own personal password wizard! It conjures up an enchanted code just for you. Simply provide the details, and it'll sprinkle some digital fairy dust to create a password that's as unique as a unicorn wearing a tuxedo. From the length to the character types, it's like picking toppings for a password pizza. So get ready to embrace the magic and let's get this password party started!

## Features

Here are the features of our password generator:
Allows the user to select a password length between 8 and 128 characters long. No more tiny or overly long passwords! We'll also ensure you stick to integers only, so no wacky decimals allowed.

Allows the user to select one or more of the following character types:
Lowercase characters: Keep it casual.
Uppercase characters: SHOUT your password out loud.
Numbers: Add a little bit of math to your password game.

Special characters: Throw in some extra spice! We've got all the symbols to make your password pop.

Once you've customized your password to your heart's content, there's a nifty "Copy to Clipboard" button. With a single click, you can magically copy your newly generated password and paste it wherever you need it. No more pesky manual typing!

There you have it, neat and clear like a freshly organized sock drawer. Enjoy the password-generating goodness!
